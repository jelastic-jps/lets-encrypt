**Let's Encrypt** is a free solution for automated SSL certificates issuing. 
Just select a required *Environment* from the list below and specify the attached *External Domain(s)*.  

**Note:** 
* Leave the *External Domain(s)* field blank for issuing a test SSL certificate bound to the internal environment domain.
* Public IP address will be automatically attached to all nodes within the entry point layer (application server or load balancer).
