Your Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate will remain valid for 90 days. 
One month before expiration the system will automatically request the certificate update,

To perform update manually at any time, use the **Update Now** button at the add-on’s panel.  
${globals.skippedDomainsText}

Also, the used domain names list can be adjusted later with the **Configure** button.
